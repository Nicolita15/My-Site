<p>El barco is a Spanish sci-fi mystery TV series, that started on 17 January 2011. It tells the story of the Estrella polar, a school ship that goes into the Atlantic Ocean for what's expected to be a voyage of two months. At the helm of the ship stands Captain Ricardo Montero , who comes into the ship with his daughters, 20-year-old Ainhoa, and 6-year-old Valeria, whose mother has recently died. Julia Wilson is the ship's scientist, Juli√°n de La Cuadra is the captain's right hand, Salome is the cook, with "Burbuja" helping her, and some of the students/crew members are Ulises, Piti, Estela, Ramiro, Vilma and priest Andres, among others.
At first, it seems that everything will be going okay. Things start to get juicy and the LHC starts working and accidentally recreates the Big Bang, apparently killing everyone in Geneva and expanding all over the world. A gigantic storm washes over the Estrella polar, soon acquiring the look of a hurricane, but the ship survives miraculously thanks to being in a series of coordinates where they are protected from the storm thanks to a submarine fault line. Soon, it becomes apparent that the disappearance of the other ships from the radar isn't a coincidence: it soon becomes apparent that the ship might be the only sign of human life resting in the world.</p>
